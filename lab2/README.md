# Lab2

Follow KC's write up of the assignment here: https://eecs.wsu.edu/~cs360/LAB2.html

Place your source code in directly the src directory. It is preferred that you use the existing t.c format to place your code, however, you may modify it as long as the `mk` sh script compiles your code (which of course you may modify such that it does compile your code.)

## To Turn In:
Push your files to GitHub Classroom (see [here](https://eecs.wsu.edu/~cs360/ta_resources/howto-linux-cmds.html) for more details if you do not know how to submit using Git/GitHub Classroom).

Note you must `git push` your code to submit it. Submissions automatically occur based on the last pushed commit whenever the assignment is due.

## Samples
As usual, samples may be found at https://eecs.wsu.edu/~cs360/samples/LAB2. You may download them via the `wget` utility (see the [How-To Linux Command page](https://eecs.wsu.edu/~cs360/ta_resources/howto-linux-cmds.html) on the course webpage if you are unfamiliar).

Note both `lab2.bin` and `lab2.static.bin` are executables and may be run after using `chmod +x`, whereas `lab2base.c` is starter code.
