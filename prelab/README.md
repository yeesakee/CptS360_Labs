Part 4 of the prelab we are simply checking to make sure you understand the output of the stack contents. This part is done MANUALLY. You can accomplish this by using print statements or copying the output to a new file and labeling the stack contents there. Please get your outputs to look as similar to KC's as possible.

Place your code solely in the provided files. If you must use other files (you shouldn't have to, please let us know if a file seems to be missing), make sure the ./mk script is modified.

Ensure that your code will compile and run when the ./mk script is ran. That is how we are batch compiling and testing output on the backend so ./mk needs to work for us to see that your code works. You may need to change the mk script, that is totally fine. If we omitted anything important from it, please let us know and we wil update it in our template repository. 

# To Turn In:
Push your files to our GitHub classroom (See Zach's How-To Linux as a reference if you don't know how to submit).
